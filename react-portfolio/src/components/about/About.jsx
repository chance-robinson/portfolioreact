          <p>
            My name is Chance Robinson, I am a Junior Computer Science major going into my Senior year, I have
extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C++, Java, and other frameworks developed during my courses and projects at Brigham Young University.
I have always been passionate about web development, which has led me to pursue a Bachelor of Computer
Science degree. Although I have gained knowledge through college education, applying code outside of school and going past requirements has allowed to 
experience the most growth as a programmer.</p>
<p> A project that I have enjoyed working on lately has been this website. I have had the opportunity to challenge myself by learning 
new libraries, frameworks, and implementing a variety of technologies I have never used before with zero assistance. I created both the front-end and back-end and
even challenged myself to host this on a production linux server. </p>
<p>I look forward to learning more frameworks, libraries, and challenging myself every day.
          </p>
